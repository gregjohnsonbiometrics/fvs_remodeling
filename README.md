This repo holds scripts and supporting files to re-model Forest Vegetation Simulator (`FVS`) component growth and imputation models for CONUS.

Some early priorities are:

1. Establish a uniform site productivity measure for CONUS (perhaps similar to `Climate SI`).
2. Develop a robust system for establishing the age of a plot (or perhaps a tree).
3. Develop growth equations capable of unbiased estimate across all species.
